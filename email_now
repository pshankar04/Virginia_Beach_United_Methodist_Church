 Dear Heather McEntee,

Thank You. I will do my best.

Please find the below link for the sample page. Hope it reflects what you had explained before.

Current flow of the page :

The Assessment has only 5 questions and as you answer all the questions and click on "SUBMIT" button

1)  You will see an alert-box popping up showing the the summation of the weights of your options ordered. Click OK

2)  Another alert-box pops up with index positions from highest summations to lower summations, named as GIFTS (G1 G2 G3)

Well i know that , this does not resemble our current assessment. I will modify as you confirm its working.

I attempted the test, you will see my answers in the attached picture (Qno_AnsweChoices.jpg), I received points as shown in ("Latest_Attempt.jpg") file.

Now i don't understand, how i received 

11 points - MERCY/COMPASSION
11 points - LEADERSHIP/LEADING WITH DILIGENCE
10 points - INTERCESSION
I referred following documents from your attachment, but did not understand much.

Please find my other attached files ("mappings.jpg"), which i produced during analysis.

Meanwhile, i try to understand the Gifts in terms of the Spiritual Context, if possible please brief me how you decide the points after the assessment.

Apologies for asking these doubts again.

Thanks & Regards,
Puneeth
